2017-12-16T17:12:13.683+0000	REG-10	Distribute reports	Need to convert to epic. General idea is to send reports by email and or post to a file server so that the emails can just be an alert with links to the reports.

2017-12-11T11:46:25.481+0000	REG-9	Visualisations	Need to convert to an epic. General idea is to get a report or library of reports, maybe just ascii but more likely some fancy js or even pdf.

2017-12-11T11:44:38.424+0000	REG-8	Configuration manager	This needs conversion to an epic which I can't do in the phone app. Idea is to have some sort of interactive console or window so that a non technical test manager can set up the project without editing files directly.

2017-12-16T17:11:57.656+0000	REG-7	Configure connection using a config file  	As a Test Manager I want the details for a connection such as the target URL and authentication details to be stored in a text file in order to avoid having to edit code when changing the connection.

2017-12-11T11:41:08.097+0000	REG-6	High medium and low bugs as a percentage data	As a test manager I want a text file containing the percentage of high medium and low bugs logged every day in order track quality trends  If we're raising lots of bugs but they're all low priority that's probably okay, if the trend is rising high priority bugs then that's terrible!

2017-12-16T17:11:11.753+0000	REG-4	Doesn't exist	Well of course it doesn't, but I need at least one bug in Jira, in order to code against some data.	Done	kim@nobay.co.uk	2017-12-10T20:04:17.790+0000	kim@nobay.co.uk	https://jempython.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/10003
2017-12-11T11:40:59.663+0000	REG-3	Open bugs and how long they've been open data	As a test manager I want a text file containing a list of all bugs and how long they've been open in order to allocate resources effectively	Backlog	Not assigned	2017-12-10T20:02:11.928+0000	kim@nobay.co.uk	https://jempython.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/10002
2017-12-11T11:40:43.291+0000	REG-2	Bell curve data	As a test manager I want the number of open, new and closed bugs written to a text file every night in order to plot a bell curve.  Text file called bellcurve.txt to contain, tab separated data with the format::    Date   New  Open   Closed    New and closed is the number created new and closed on that date, rather than the cumulative.

2017-12-16T17:11:36.797+0000	REG-1	Data collector	Well I'd pretty happy if we managed to get this done.	In Progress	kim@nobay.co.uk	2017-12-10T19:36:33.184+0000	kim@nobay.co.uk	https://jempython.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/10000
